# ESE 224 - Course Project

## Overview

This C++ project focuses on enhancing the reliability of power supply systems for five substations (EB, OF, RL, TM, and HD) in Central New York State. Each substation is crucial for powering a distinct hospital, with backup generators in place during outages. The project's core is to manage and analyze outage data to optimize power delivery, particularly for essential medical services.

## Features

1. **Ticket Database Management**
   - Implements a database to manage tickets during power outages.
   - Features include adding, updating, and querying ticket information.

2. **Surgeon Team Database Management**
   - Manages performance data for surgeon teams across five hospitals.
   - Allows adding/removing teams or surgeons, logging surgeries, and analyzing performance.

3. **Power Optimization Algorithm**
   - An algorithm that optimizes backup power distribution among surgeon teams to ensure critical surgeries proceed during outages.

4. **Minimizing Customer Hour Interruptions**
   - Strategies to reduce the impact of power outages, efficiently dispatch repair crews, and prioritize urgent repairs.

5. **Future Outage Prediction and Planning**
   - Uses historical data to predict future outages and prepare the infrastructure and medical facilities accordingly.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (C++11 or later is recommended)
- Basic knowledge of database management, power systems, and outage management
